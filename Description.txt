 
As the number of dimentions increses it is a  curse.Reason for that Accuracy always impacted with the increase dimentionality
 i.e Accuracy decreases with respect to dimentional increases
     Accuracy increase with respect to dimentional decrese.



. SKlearn internaly having datasets lab, according that 30 features means 30 dimentions
  (data set: load_breast_canser)

. According to PCA 30 dimention reduced into 2 dimention 
  (Dimention will be create concedering all 30 features so that, 
  nothing lack or loss feature importance)

. Two types of targets 1. Malignant & 2.Benian (represented as 0 for Malignant & 1 for Benian )

. Creating dataframe my first attribute is data and second attribute is features_names

. Through standardscalar we converting all feature values into range of 0 - 1.i.e., scale 
  (we can use minmaxscalar also) 

. So, data became scale and now transform that.Weget array form of data.

. Now we can use PCA technique/method.

. PCA performed dimentionality reduction infact not done any modeling (X_PCA)
  (so we get 2 dimentions than 30 dimentions)

. Now we have to perform any machine learning modeling like logistics or ect...using reduced dimentionality 
  with respect to target values Malignant & Benian
